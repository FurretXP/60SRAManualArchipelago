# 60SRAManualArchipelago
A manual archipelago for the game 60 Seconds! Reatomized



## Rules/Info
You are not allowed to grab items you don’t have unlocked yet.
Because food and water is such an essential part of the game, you are automatically given those to use and grab. Everything else will be locked behind checks.
Any items you find during expeditions that you do not have unlocked cannot be used even if they are brought up in any prompts.
Family members are included as item checks, so you will just be alone as Ted until someone unlocks another family member for you. 
You must play as Ted, because Dolores is included as an item check and I’m lazy.
The goal is to go towards whatever ending you want to go towards. However, all endings will be included. If you are truly psychopathic (me), you can make your goal to be all endings or just several endings. The goal button will be separate from endings so you can manually release it based on what you want your goal to be.
